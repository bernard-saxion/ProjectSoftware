\chapter{Result}
We are Team 5 of class EEL1IB, Saxion Enschede, in our second quarter we will be making a Vault using the Arduino platform for Project Software. This document details our initial plans.

\begin{tabular}[hbp]{lll}
\hline Importance & Issue & Requirement \\ \hline
\hline Must have
& \#3 & The box can only be opened with the correct cipher \\
& \#4 & Cipher is encoded as a three-digit number or as three two-digit numbers \\
& \#5 & Cipher to unlock box is entered with a rotary encoder \\
& \#6 & The cipher being entered is displayed on a set of seven-segment displays \\
& \#7 & The system is implemented on the arduino microcontroller platform \\
& \#8 & Seven-segment displays are driven with one or more shift registers \\
& \#9 & Lock is secured with a servo \\
\hline Should have
& \#1 & System provides an enclosed box \\
& \#2 & The box is lockable \\
\hline Could have
& \#10 & There is some form of audal feedback to the user \\
& \#11 & The cipher may be changed through the serial communication \\
& \#12 & The cipher may not be changed when the box is locked \\
\hline Won't have
& \#13 & Changing the cipher is done through a graphical user interface \\
\hline

We were given requirements.
\chapter{Activities}

\chapter{Planning}
We foresaw deadlines.

\begin{tabular}[hbp]{llr}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{c}{Due date} & Product \\
\hline
2014-11-26 & Week 2 & Project Plan \\
2014-12-10 & Week 4 & Design \\
2015-01-14 & Week 7 & Reflection \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\chapter{Risks}
We migitated risks.

\begin{description}
	\item [Hardware failures] Cheaper components may be restocked from the hardware lab, more expensive components will have to be ordered, many webshops have 1-day shipping so the risk of delays is minimal.
