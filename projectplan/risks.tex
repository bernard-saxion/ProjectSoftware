\chapter{Risks}

This chapter details a list of risks that our project could face and for each comments on how we expect to minimise its effects on our project results.

\section{Project scope}
Many of the risks with project scope are migitated by using the V-Model, where requirements and amount of work are solidified with the project plan at the start of the project.

\section{Project planning}
\begin{description}
\item[The turnaround time is underestimated] To minimise the turnaround time, continuous testing is done during the implementation phase. \\
\item[Setback are not taken into account] There is some room for overtime in the two-week holiday in the middle of the implementation phase, when things get really bad, the requirements of lesser importance will have to be forgone. \\
\item[The final date is postponed or unrealistic] The requirements have been triaged so when the final date turns out to be unrealistic the most important aspects of the project have gotten the best chance of getting finished. \\
\item[The discussion makes processing to long] Every hot-topic discussion must be resolved within 24 hours of the first meeting it was addressed in, if it is not, it might incur delays on the estimated project completion date. \\
\end{description}

\section{Market}
\begin{description}
\item[Some ordered items may need some time to arrive] Most webshops have an ``order today, delivered tomorrow'' program. Which should be quick enough.\\
\item[The high price of some materials] None of the components are excessively expensive. \\
\item[Cannot find some materials] Inquire with client about acceptable replacements. \\
\end{description}

\section{Materials}
\begin{description}
\item[Don't know how to use some materials] Request additional guidance during the supervised working hours. \\
\end{description}

\section{Facilities and tools}
\begin{description}
\item[Poor availability] Work from home or rent equipment. \\
\item[Unreliable tools] Get angry at oneself for not making proper backups. Whilst waiting on the repairs or replacement, reflect on work and draft on paper. \\
\item[Incompatible tools] Rebuild from scratch during overtime. \\
\end{description}

\section{People}
\begin{description}
\item[Project members change] Revise project planning. \\
\item[Limited availability of project members] Consult with project supervisors. Drop less important requirements to make the schedule fit. \\
\item[Misplaced priorities] Split tasks into subtasks and triage them using MoSCoW.
\item[Project members that flee] Install new management. Revise project planning. \\
\item[Illness] Revise project planning. \\
\item[Family problems] Decrease workload overhead. Decrease workload. Consult with supervisors. \\
\item[Ethical questions] Elevate questions to project supervisors. \\
\item[Poor performance] Identify constraints and try to resolve them. Decrease workload overhead. \\
\item[Conflict] Look into possibility of assigning members to separate subsystems instead of working together. \\
\item[Poor motivation] Consult with project supervisors. Press for relocation of member. \\
\item[Attitude] Increase workload. \\
\item[Insufficient competence] Reassign member tasks of different nature. Reassign member tasks of lesser importance. \\
